Skoltech was created during 2011 in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). <br/>
Today, Skoltech has some 1,000 master’s and PhD students who follow studies in areas ranging from petroleum engineering, 
energy systems, photonics, quantum materials and data science to materials science and engineering, life science, mathematical and theoretical physics, 
as well as space and engineering systems. <br/>
![alt text][logo] Central to the campus are its multi-story laboratories that accommodate lab space, work and teaching areas, as well as the associated offices, 
encompassing all 12 laboratory buildings with an outer ring (nearly a kilometer in overall length) and two bisecting inner rings.

---

The Machine Learning Summer School stretches back to 2002 when two very distinguished scientists, B. Scholkopf and A. Smola, first created it. Since then, 36 schools have been organized in multiple countries.

Skoltech’s Machine Learning Summer School, taking place from August 26 to September 6, 2019, drew participants from 36 countries across the world. Initially, our MLSS attracted 800+ applications from over 40 countries. Nearly half were PhD students, 21% were from industry, 23% were MSc students, and 7% postdocs from academia.

A total of 250 tickets were sold, half the participants were Russian and 8% of these were enrolled at Skoltech. Members of industry represented 40% of the participants, most of whom work for companies in Russia. German participants made up 9% of attendees, Chinese made up 5.5%, with both representing the largest international contingents. Participants and speakers hailed from world-renowned institutions such as Stanford University, Cornell University, Carnegie Mellon, Oxford University, ETH Zurich, TU Munich, and others.

MLSS is a great opportunity to meet with specialists in various fields of machine learning and to network with fellow students from all corners of the globe.

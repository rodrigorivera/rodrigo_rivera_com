Mark Girolami has had an unusual pathway to an active and distinguished research career in that the first decade after graduating from the University of Glasgow, he worked as a professional chartered engineer with IBM where he gained experience in high volume manufacturing, process automation, and electronic system design. He left IBM in his early thirties to start from scratch and undertake a PhD funded by National Cash Registers, the remit being to investigate the statistical signal processing required to support biometric speaker verification. 

Girolami completed the Ph.D. in two years while working at a further education college, during which his research work came to the attention of senior research leaders on the international stage, and invitations were extended for him to spend time at their research laboratories. In particular, Girolami worked at both the Computational Neurobiology Laboratory of Prof. T. Sejnowski at the Salk Institute of Biological Studies and the Brain Science Institute headed up by Prof S.I.Amari at the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) in Wako-Shi, Tokyo.
